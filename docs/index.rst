Python Core Sprint 2020
=======================

Issue Tracker and Discussions: https://github.com/python/core-sprint

For questions and suggestions about the sprint, please open an issue or
a discussion item in the `core-sprint <https://github.com/python/core-sprint>`_
repo.

For sensitive and private discussions, please get in touch with one of the
organizers: Mariatta, Kyle Stanley or Ewa Jodlowska.

The sprint is scheduled for **Oct 19 - 23, 2020**. This will be an online event
instead of the in-person sprint.

The sprint is normally a weeklong (5 work days) sprint, where we would have
focus time to work on CPython, finish your PEPs, review pull requests, etc.

All core devs, Python triage members, and active core dev mentees are
invited to participate.
