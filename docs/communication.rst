Communication
=============

The sprint is attended by people from various timezones, so expect more
asynchronous discussions throughout the sprint.

We will be using Discord to communicate during the sprint.

Additionally we will use Zoom for the kick-off and send-off meetings and for
group video chats.

Starting a new meeting
----------------------

You're free to schedule a meeting with another participant anytime. When you
scheduled a meeting, please add the meeting to the shared Google Calendar.
Once you add the meeting to Google Calendar, it will be automatically announced
on Discord. Other sprint attendees will be able to discover your scheduled
meeting, and join in if they're interested too.

Remember to take notes during your meeting!

Note taking
-----------

We heard that people didn't like HackMD from last year's sprint. So this time
we have decided to use Google Docs. We will be creating the Google Docs and
share the links.

When you're in a group meeting, please remember to take down notes, so those
unable to attend the meeting can get up speed.

We have created a Google Doc for each project. You can find the link to
the notes in :ref:`projects`. We will ensure that each participant will
have access to all the docs as it gets closer to the sprint.
