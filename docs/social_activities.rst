__________________________________

Thank you for purchasing ESC From Cell 126. We can’t wait for you to get escaping!
Make sure you read this email carefully. It includes **important information**
about the game and **your unique game link**.


**The important bits...**


**Your team**

You can have as many players in you team as you like but we think the game works
best with 2-6 people. If you are playing with a remote team, you will need to
set up a video call so you can talk to each other. We recommend using an app
with the ability to screenshare such as Zoom, Google Meet, or Skype.

**VERY IMPORTANT!!**

If you are using the same device to play the game and video call, **do not
block the right hand side of your screen** - this is where your clues are stored
and you might miss them!!

**Remote teams: to screenshare…or not to screenshare**

You have two options when it comes to playing with a remote team:

**Option 1)** You, as the organiser, go to the game link on your laptop or PC
and screen share the game with your team. Get your team to go to the game link on
their phones so they can read clues independently.

**Option 2)** Your whole team goes to the game link on their laptop or PCs.
This allows everyone to see the full game and interact with clues and puzzles.
Just like in a real escape room, when one person solves a puzzle, it is solved
for everyone. Similarly, if one person asks for a clue, the clue is shown to
everyone.

We like option one for teamwork but option two means everyone gets to play around
with the puzzles. The choice is yours!

**Your device and browser**

A desktop or laptop is ideal but ultimately, you’ll need a device which is at
least as big as an iPad in order to view the full game. You can view the clues
on any device. Check whether your device is compatible by going to this
`link <https://escthegame.com/testMyDevice>`_.

You should use the latest version of Google Chrome or Firefox to play the game
on your laptop or PC. Other browsers may work but we cannot guarantee that all
features will be supported. If you are using an iPad, we recommend using Safari.

**What if I get stuck?**

There are three hints available for every puzzle within the game.
The hints will progressively give you more information. If you still do not
have the correct answer after three hints, you will be able to view the answer.

**Timings**

You can start the game when you like. There is no time limit but most players
finish the game in around 1 hour.

**Can I play it again?**

Your game link is unique and can only be used once. If you accidentally leave
your game mid session, you can come back to it using the same link - all your
progress will be saved.

**The exciting bits...**

Your unique game links:

We will populate the `Google Sheets <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VEY1-Gkl9R1f-QBZlcdDNzYe3S_uHFXdhRwbEC6T3Oc/edit?usp=sharing>`_.
with the game links prior to the start of the sprint.


Good luck and happy escaping!
