Python community Q&A session
============================

We will be collecting questions via `slido`_. We will then assign a question
to a core dev before the Q&A start, so the core dev can come prepared with answer.

The community Q&A session will be recorded and published to The PSF's YouTube channel.

Schedule: Tuesday, Oct 20, 2020, 3 PM Central time.

Python community can ask a question to core devs via `slido`_. This will be open
between **September 24 - September 30**.
