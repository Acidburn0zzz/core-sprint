Python community Q&A session
============================

We have collected questions from the community via `slido`_. We will then assign
a question to a core dev before the Q&A start, so the core dev can come
prepared with answer.

The community Q&A session will be recorded and published to The PSF's YouTube channel.

Schedule: Tuesday, Oct 20, 2020, 3 PM Central time.

Python community had the opportunity to ask a question to core devs via `slido`_.
This was open between **September 24 - September 30**.

Core developers, please go to this `Google Sheets`_ and assign a question to yourself.
We suggest prioritize answering the ones with most upvotes, however feel free to
pick a question that you're comfortable with answering.
